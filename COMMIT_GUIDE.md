## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If CI workflow fails:

1. Check Go version in workflow matches your project
2. Ensure all tests pass locally first
3. Check workflow file syntax
4. Review GitHub Actions logs for details

### If badges don't show:

1. Wait a few minutes for GitHub to process
2. Verify repository is public
3. Check badge URLs in README.md

### If templates don't appear:

1. Ensure `.github/` folder is in root directory
2. Verify file names match exactly
3. Push `.github/` folder explicitly
4. Check GitHub → Issues → New Issue (should show templates)

## ✨ You're Ready!

Once committed and pushed:

1. ✅ Your documentation will be live on GitHub
2. ✅ CI/CD will start running automatically
3. ✅ Issue/PR templates will be available
4. ✅ Community can start engaging

**Next Step**: Follow the `LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` to prepare for public announcement!

## 💡 Pro Tip

Create a `docs-overhaul` branch first if you want to review everything:

```bash
# Create branch
git checkout -b docs-overhaul

# Commit changes
git add -A
git commit -m "docs: comprehensive documentation overhaul"

# Push branch
git push origin docs-overhaul

# Create PR on GitHub to review before merging to main
```

This lets you review the changes on GitHub before making them official!
